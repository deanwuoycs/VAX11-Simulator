40. We didn't create LST files well for filenames with capital extension, ie. .ASM.
41. Pressing Ctrl+G when the file was empty cuases the simulator to crash
42. Fixed bug in bbs, bbc commands - doesn't make the simulator crashs anymore

Feutures:
-----------
* Added option to disable the physical memory simulation - 
  Improving the simulator speed by almost 100%

Bugs Fix:
-----------
37. ".long label1, label2" when both labels need to be filled in pass2 didn't
    compile correctly
38. 2 missing addressing modes added
39. Fixed bug: free didn't update the pointers in the array correctly

Bugs Fix:
-----------
26. cmp didn't work well with negative numbers
27. Pressing on Arrows keys on console make the console to stop responding
28. decl didn't raise overflow flag
29. Creating LST file using Ctrl+L shortcut marked the original document
    as "need to be saved" even if the user didn't actually changed it
30. Many of the examples of the help didn't work as "%x" has changed to "%lx"
    sometime in the way.
31. Icon for cut/copy/paste in the toolbar was incorrect
32. Program sometimes crashed when the user pressed on F5/F11
33. Paste didn't update breakpoints correctly
34. If opcode type was 'b', $NUMBER addressing mode didn't code correctly
35. The assembler didn't allocate enough space for pass2 if two undefined
    labels were on the same line.

Feutures:
-----------
* Removed SandBar for stability

Bugs Fix:
-----------
21. The offset in addressing mode offset[rX] calculated incorrectly
22. Output interupts didn't work.
23. In index addressing mode index register and base address register have to be different
24. Bug with pass2 of the compiler and addressing mode from type 'a' (didn't save enough space).
25. calls, callg ignore masking of R11

Feutures:
-----------
* Many new icons to the menu and the toolbar

Bugs Fix:
-----------
12. Solved hebrew problem - couldn't save files containing hebrew
13. Multplies spaces inside a string were becoming a single space
14. Pressing on X button sometimes closed the wrong window
15. Software Interrupts not always work (problem with Math.Log function)
16. cvt opcode didn't always change the overflow flag correctly
17. offset[rX] addressing mode compiled as offset(rX)
18. (rX), (rX)+, -(rX) passed compile when needed Branch addressing mode
19. *(rX)+ didn't increment the register correctly
20. *(rX)+[rY] didn't increment rX correctly


Feutures:
-----------
* Added PSL to the special registers view
* Switched the menus and the toolbar to SandBar library - new look for the simulator
* Extended the simulator's help
* Compiler is much faster now - reducing the number of memory allocations by 1:1000

Bugs Fix:
-----------
1.  puts bug - string like "hello\\" displayed incorrectly
2.  output using special register crashed the simulator
3.  scanf - we counted the parameters when we used "%*d".
4.  scanf - scanf need always to write 4 bytes.
5.  printf: printed 0 when needed to print negative numbers
6.  The option "Show LST file after compiling caused an infinite loop
7.  If we close the program in the middle of input function, we don't close debug mode
8.  free function failed on some conditions to free memory
9.  fixed bug that prevert ".set LABEL, '?" to pass compile
10. Reading end of line from input files didn't work correctly
11. paste text in the console window sent "\r\n" instead of "\n".
    Now pasting text to programs will work as expected

Feutures:
-----------
* memory updates display only on breaks now.
* added option to control the compile errors background color
* Added LABEL/CONSTANT to the LST file display
